# Jetson Cluster
Repo for instructions on setting up a micro compute cluster with the [NVIDIA Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) boards and potentially Ansible playbooks for configuration and setup.

## Initial Steps

These steps will be needed to get the board initially up and working regardless. Once you have gotten the OS/system initially setup we'll move on to either step by step instructions or how to use the Ansible playbooks to get your cluster setup. I will recommend the Ansible approach unless you have experience with Linux sysadmin as it hopefully will simplify getting started for you.
